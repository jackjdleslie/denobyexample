# `WIP` Deno by Example

> A website to teach Deno and JavaScript through annotated examples.

## About

A side project for me to learn more about Deno and JavaScript, inspired by [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com)

## Adding an example

Create a new `.mdx` file in the `pages/examples` folder [using frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/writing-pages/#using-frontmatter-in-mdx)

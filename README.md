# `WIP` Deno by Example

> A website to teach Deno and JavaScript through annotated examples.

## About

A side project for me to learn more about Deno and JavaScript, inspired by [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com)

## Adding an example

> Use `pages/examples/hello-world.js` as a guideline.

1. Create a file in `pages/examples` - ensure that spaces are denoted with `-`.
2. Default export a `Layout` component with `title`, `code`, `next` and `output` props.
3. Write your example text as a child node of the `Layout`.

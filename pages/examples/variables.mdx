  // variables.js
  
  // we define a variable str with a string typed value
  var str = "road";

  // we can use the typeof keyword to get the type of the value in a variable
  console.log(typeof str);

  // if we don't define a variable, the value will be undefined
  var x;

  // we can still use typeof on an undefined variable
  console.log(typeof x);

  // variables defined with var are mutable, so we can change the value whenever
  str = "route";
  x = "sixty-six";

  // we can print out the values of variables too
  console.log(str, x);

  // if the variables aren't typed but they are mutable, we can also change the type of value!
  x = 66;

  // we can print out a mix of strings and numbers
  console.log(str, x);

  $ deno run variables.js
  string
  undefined
  route sixty-six

In JavaScript, variables are simply destinations for typed values. This
means that there is no explicit type definition needed when defining a
variable. As you can see below, this means that a variable can hold any
type of value.

The keyword `var` declares one or more variables, and if you 
don't explicitly assign a variable a value then its value is `undefined`.

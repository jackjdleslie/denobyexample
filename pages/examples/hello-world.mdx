The first program you should write is the traditional "hello world"
program, which lets you get to grips with the execution environment as
well as basic program output.

The console provides a way to debug programs by outputting data at various
points during a programs execution.

If you run `console.log` when writing JavaScript in the
browser, you would see the output in the browser's console. In Node.js, we
will simply see the output in the terminal.
